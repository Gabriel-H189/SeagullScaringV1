# Seagull Scaring V1
By Gabriel Alonso-Holt.

A seagull scaring program with CLI interface written in Python.

The days of having me run around scaring seagulls manually are over!
With Seagull Scaring, you can just start the program, choose a time to scare seagulls for, and relax as the seagulls fly away when you want.

**Before you proceed, sound effects are not included!**

Recommended settings: 2700 seconds (timer), 60 seconds (min time), 300 seconds (max time), seagull (sound).

### About this project
Seagull Scaring was created to stop the biggest problem plaguing my school since I canâ€™t remember when. 
It has been tested to have a 98% success rate against seagulls (or shall I say gulls) of all shapes and sizes! 
The recommended settings are meant to be used during 1 lunchtime.
